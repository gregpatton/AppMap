Web Applicaiton Mapping Using Python

This Python 2.7.4 script accepts a url as a command line argument and gathers basic information about the site from other web resources.  The output is a web report, report.htm.

Sample Execution
======
$ python appmap.py www.facebook.com

Imports
======
sys, urllib, urllib2

Disclaimer
======
This is my first experiment with GitHub and Python.  I plan to add additional look-ups, improve the parsing of data, and eventually output a nice looking report.
